    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A true French omelette is just eggs and butter, no filling.</p>
    <p>The egg is folded for a soft, tender texture.</p>
    <p>
      The technique does take a bit of practice to perfect but you'll be amazed
      at just how delicious these few ingredients can be when elevated using
      this method.
